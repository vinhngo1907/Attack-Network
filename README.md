### The scripts doesn't work for me, what I do wrong?
All of the script are tested and developed on Ubuntu (18.04). So please use also Ubuntu :) There are multiple things that can go wrong, please following this checklist:

  1. Python (2.7) installed? On Ubuntu: apt-get install python

  2. Scapy installed? On Ubuntu: apt-get install python-scapy

  3. Script executed as root? On Linux: sudo python coolscript.py

If the script still not work, please contact us. For that you can open a Github Issue.

### Do I have to use a specific platform?

No, theoretically the scripts should work on every platform that run python 2.7 and scapy. But we stronly recommend to use Linux (e.g. Ubuntu). Our development platform is Ubuntu 18.04, so on this platform the scripts should work.
